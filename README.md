# The Film Landscape: Examining Top Grossing and Highly Rated Films
This is a collaborative Phase 1 project completed by Joe Resis and Mark Patterson in October 2020.


## Background
In this project, we find ourselves working as consultants to the newly created Microsoft Movie Studios. We have been tasked with provideing an overviw of the Movie industry and providing some recommendations on how they should enter this lucrative but competitive market. We have decided to first provide a high level overview of the industry based on 3 key success metrics. These are: 

1. Financial: What movies have the highest domestic gross? 
2. Popularity: Which movies have the highest number of ratings?
3. Quality: What movies have the highest average rating? 

Through the evaluation of the titles in 3 top 20 lists we have created, we make recommendations on which genres of film Microsoft should consider exploring. 

As the "story" is the heart and soul of a film, we identify the writers that have worked on the top grossing films and proide a list of these writers as a starting point for possible partners for Microsoft to pursue. We conclude with some opportuinities for additional research.
