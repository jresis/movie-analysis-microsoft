# The Film Landscape: Examining Top Grossing and Highly Rated Films
This is a collaborative Phase 1 project completed by Joe Resis and Mark Patterson in October 2020.


## Background
In this project, we find ourselves working as consultants to the newly created Microsoft Movie Studios. We have been tasked with provideing an overviw of the Movie industry and providing some recommendations on how they should enter this lucrative but competitive market. We have decided to first provide a high level overview of the industry based on 3 key success metrics. These are: 

1. Financial: What movies have the highest domestic gross? 
2. Popularity: Which movies have the highest number of ratings?
3. Quality: What movies have the highest average rating? 

Through the evaluation of the titles in 3 top 20 lists we have created, we make recommendations on which genres of film Microsoft should consider exploring. 

As the "story" is the heart and soul of a film, we identify the writers that have worked on the top grossing films and proide a list of these writers as a starting point for possible partners for Microsoft to pursue. We conclude with some opportuinities for additional research. 


## Methodology
**Data:** For this project we relied upon data from IMDb and Box Office Mojo. 
* We used existing data files that were provided to us. 
* As the files are several years old, we needed to limit the date range of the data used. We decided a six year period from 2013 to 2018 would provide us adequate data. 
* As our client is interested in an initial launch only in the US, we limited the films we examined to English language only and looked just at domestic gross revenues. 

**Data Manipulation and Analysis:** exploratory data analysis, merging of files, examining descriptive statistics and plots of central tendency and dispurion, creating new columns from values in existing columns (genres, Year), and methods for dropping columns and rows to simplify analysis. 

**Output:** From our data frames we produced a series of top 20 Lists visualized with Bar charts, and a table listing the names of writers and the films they worked on.
